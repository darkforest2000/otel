# Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

## Application Flow
1. HTTP requests are handled by [handler/handler.go](mdc:handler/handler.go)
2. Handlers call business logic in [usecase/usecase.go](mdc:usecase/usecase.go)
3. Use cases interact with the database through [storage/storage.go](mdc:storage/storage.go)

## Telemetry Flow
1. OpenTelemetry SDK is set up in [otel.go](mdc:otel.go)
2. Telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) is sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector
3. The collector processes and forwards data to backends (Jaeger, ClickHouse, Prometheus)
4. Visualization is available through Jaeger UI and Grafana dashboards

## Error Handling & Tracing
1. HTTP handlers use `httpErrorHelper` to properly set span status and record errors
2. UseCase layer uses centralized error handling with `handleError` function
3. All errors are properly propagated and recorded in spans
4. Client errors (4xx) do not mark server spans as error, following OTel conventions
5. Server errors (5xx) properly mark spans as error

## Components
- **Handler Layer**: Responsible for HTTP routing, request parsing, and response formatting
- **Use Case Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
- **Storage Layer**: Handles database interactions and data persistence
- **Logger**: Provides structured OpenTelemetry-based logging
- **Tractx**: Provides utilities for trace context management
